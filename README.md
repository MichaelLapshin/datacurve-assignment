# Message to the Datacurve
Hello Datacurve,

I was informed on Friday evening that I was selected to do a take-home assignment over the weekend.

While I would be happy to complete this assignment, I unfortunately did not have the several hours needed to work on the assessment this weekend. I had to travel to the US and back all while preparing for two exams happening early this week.

I would gladly complete this take-home assessment at a later date. Could I complete this assignment by Thursday June 6 at 12pm? Please send an email to `mlapshin@uwaterloo.ca` if this works for you.

I would not want to miss the opportunity to interview with you. I am 4th-year Software Engineering student and have gathered great experience in software development. I have also worked at 5 co-ops jobs and on many side-projects. Therefore, I believe that I would be stronge candidate for this role. Please refer to my resume for more details.

Please see my past GitHub projects as reference for Software Development skills. They README also provides descriptions and graphics.
